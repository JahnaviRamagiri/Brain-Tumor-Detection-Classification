## Aim of Project

_To Detect Brain Tumor and Classify it as Benign or Malignant using Image Processing techniques with the help of MATLAB._

The main aim of this project is to detect the presence of tumor in the brain and to classify the tumor into benign or malignant by separately segmenting the tumor from the brain and extracting the desired features from it using Image processing techniques in MATLAB

**Objective**

- To pre-process the acquired MRI dataset using suitable filters.
- To detect and extract the tumor from the pre-processed image using image transformation techniques.
- To classify the Image as Benign or Malignant based on Extracted Features.
